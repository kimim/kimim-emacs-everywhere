Most of the code is come from Brian Chavez's [[https://github.com/bchavez/AutoHotKeyEmacs][AutoHotKeyEmacs]], but as you know
different emacs users have different key bindings, thus this repo modify and add
some keys frequently used by myself, to keep the same key maps with [[https://github.com/kimim/kimim-emacs][kimim-emacs]].


To use this script:
1. Install AutoHotKey, downloaded from https://www.autohotkey.com/download/
2. Open `emacs-everywhere.ahk` with `AutoHotKey.exe`, then you can see an emacs
   logo in system tray
