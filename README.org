Most of the code is come from Brian Chavez's [[https://github.com/bchavez/AutoHotKeyEmacs][AutoHotKeyEmacs]], but as you know
different emacs users have different key bindings, thus this repo modify and add
some keys frequently used by myself, to keep the same key maps with [[kimim/kimim-emacs][kimim-emacs]].

List of keys:
